# techdegree-project-5
 My 5th techdegree project

This project utilizes AJAX to pull info from an API. 
Uses the fetch method. 

Going for Exceeds: 
- Have included a search bar that will only search for the currently displayed people. 
-- Matches will turn green, while non-matches are gray. 
--- Will update whenever the search is entered. 
--- Entering an empty search will clear it. 

- Have added a background. 
- Have also added an effect in the modal where the picture will get bigger when hovered over.
